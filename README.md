### material-match
#### Asks user a variety of questions before matching them with material that is suitable for them.

## Materials: 
### - Futurelight: 
#### FUTURELIGHT™ technology allows air and vapor to permeate the fabric while maintaining waterproofness, improving temperature regulation and reducing overheating in changing weather conditions.
---
### - DryVent:
#### Constructed with a semipermeable polyurethane coating, the multi-layered fabric blocks water from getting in while allowing vapor to escape, reducing interior moisture build up. The outer face of DryVent™ fabric is also treated with a durable water-repellent finish that helps form droplets and repel water from the surface.
---
### - DotKnit:
#### DotKnit is a double-knit performance fabric that actively pulls moisture from the skin and pushes it to the outside of the garment. The fabric pairs water-repellent hydrophobic inner yarns with moisture-thirsty hydrophilic outer yarns. These yarns pull moisture from the skin through the engineered holes to the exterior. This active wicking power keeps you dry and comfortable, helping prevent hypothermia in extreme conditions. The textured, double-knit fabric structure also allows for increased airflow and sweat evaporation.

### - FutureFleece:
#### FUTUREFLEECE™ is an innovative technology that uses full-loop fabric to minimize weight and help regulate body temperature. Made with octagonal-shaped yarn, FUTUREFLEECE™ offers an improved warmth-to-weight ratio. The grid fabrication of the fleece traps additional heat within the hollow cross sections, while the full-loop construction delivers a soft next-to-skin feel.
---
### - Ventrix:
#### Ventrix™ is an innovative insulation technology that keeps your body warm without overheating, adapting to movement and regulating temperature. It pairs highly breathable fabrics with laser-perforated, stretch synthetic insulation.

Ideally asks 4 questions. Shares material information afterwards. 
There should be an option, once the user is shown their final material, to read more on the other materials.
